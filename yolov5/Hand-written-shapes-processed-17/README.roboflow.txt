==============================

This dataset was exported via roboflow.ai on December 5, 2021 at 11:23 PM GMT

It includes 118 images.
Shapes are annotated in YOLO v5 PyTorch format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 640x640 (Fit (black edges))

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* 50% probability of horizontal flip
* 50% probability of vertical flip
